                <h1>"T</h1>
                <h4>he details are not the details. They make the design,” Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped to be true. Starting to design a web page, we have to consider what it should consist of to solve the task set for it and be both usable and beautiful. Our today’s article is devoted right to those vital details that create an effective web page. Let’s briefly review what elements can be essential for a typical <a href=""> web page</a>, what impact each element has, and how it contributes to the general user experience. Packed with plenty of web design examples.</h4>

            <article>
                <h2>Header</h2>
                    <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance. </p>
                    <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
                        <li>basic elements of <a href="">brand identity</a>, usually a logo</li>
                        <li>call-to-action button</li>
                        <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
                        <li>links to the social networks</li>
                        <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
                    
                    <source src="" type="">

                    <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the most scannable zone of a web page. Whatever is the scanning pattern users stick to on a website, it starts from the top part of the page, scanned from left to right for languages using the same reading and writing pattern. It means that what is placed in the header won’t be missed, especially the elements placed in its left and right corners.</p>
                    <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
                        <li><b>hamburger menu:</b> hiding the set of links to different pages or sections behind the hamburger button called so as it consists of horizontal lines looking like a typical bread-meat-bread hamburger.</li>
                        <li><b>sticky header:</b> header that doesn’t hide away but sticks to the top part of the page when users are scrolling the page down. This way core navigation area is available at any point of interaction, which can be helpful in terms of content-heavy pages with long scrolling.</li>
                        <li><b>two-layer navigation:</b> a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header to separate two different routes of navigation that are both important for web usability.</li>
            
                    <source src="" type="">

                <h2>CTA Button</h2>
                    <p>A <a href="">call-to-action (CTA) button</a>  is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action. This action presents a conversion for a particular page or screen (for example, buy, contact, subscribe, etc.). In other words, it turns a passive user into an active one. So, technically it can be any type of button that is supported with a call-to-action text. This type of button differs from all the other buttons on the page or screen due to its engaging nature: it has to catch attention and stimulate users to do the required action.</p>
            
                    <img src="" alt="">

                    <p>About page for ShipDaddy website is a good example of the call-to-action element instantly noticeable in the general webpage layout.</p>

                    <source src="" type="">

                    <p>The web page for Mayple is formed of several sections and uses a set of consistent call-to-action buttons for each combining them effectively with the same CTA in the header, this way allowing visitors to move on from different points of their browsing the page.</p>
            

                <H2>Hero Section</H2>
                <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold (pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents the strong visual hook: a hero image, slider, catchy piece of typography, video, or anything else attracting visitors’ attention and transfers a needed message to them. Make no mistake, the term doesn’t require that all images of this kind should include a human, animal, mascot, or any other kind of character. Don’t get tricked over with that “hero” part. It can also be the product photo or the theme image featuring a landscape, a device, a building – anything, even an abstract model or composition.</p>

                <p>Options for a hero section design on a landing page design for Uni fintech service</p>
                <source src="" type="">
            
                <h2>Footer</h2>
                    <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common zone of global website navigation, the footer provides the additional field for useful links and data users may be interested in finding.</p>
                    <p>Footers can include:</p>
                    <li>brand identity signs, usually the name and logo of the company or product</li>
                    <li>links to user support sections, for example, FAQ page, About page, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Support Team, etc.</li>
                    <li>credits to website creators</li>

                    <img src="" alt="">

                <h2>Slider</h2>
                    <p>Slider is an interactive element that applies a technique of a slideshow or carousel to present different products, offers, etc. It is especially popular as a part of e-commerce and business websites to present a sort of gallery of products or services.</p>
                        <li>saving space on the page
                        <li>user engagement</li>
                        <li>attractive visual hook</li>

                        <source src="" type="">

                <h2>Search</h2>
                    <p>Internal search is a functionality that enables a visitor to browse the content inside the website and shows it according to the search query. Tuned correctly, it shows the relevant content, and this way provides the shortcut to what the user needs. </p>
                    
                    <source src="" type="">
                    
                <h2>Menu</h2>
                    <p>The menu is one of the core navigation elements in user interfaces. It is a graphical control that presents the options of interactions with the interface. Basically, it can be the list of commands – in this case, options will be presented with verbs marking possible actions like, for example, “save,” “delete,” “buy,” “send,” etc.</p>
                    
                    <source src="" type="">
                    
                    <p>Menus can be organized horizontally or vertically. Some popular types found on diverse websites are:

                    <p><b>Classic horizontal menu:</b> the most common and well-recognized type of menu which presents the core navigation organized as a horizontal line in the website header, mentioned above</p>

                    <p><b>Sidebar menu: </b>quite a classic type, presents a vertical list of options sticking to the left or right side of the web page</p>

                    <p><b>Dropdown menu: </b>a more complex type of menu for content-heavy websites; here, the list of additional options opens below the primary one when it’s clicked or hovered. Another similar option is the dropup menu, when the list opens up, not down, but the essence is the same.</p>

                    <p><b>Megamenu:</b> that’s the complex expandable menu in which the big list of multiple choices is presented in a two-dimensional dropdown layout; this approach is effective for cases with a vast number of options.</p>

                    <p><b>Hamburger menu:</b> when the hamburger button (typically marked with three horizontal lines) is clicked, the menu expands. This option saves space and is often applied to mobile versions of websites.</p>

                    <source src="" type="">

                <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
                    <p><a href="">Breadcrumbs</a> are navigation elements used to support users in a journey around the website: they get aware of where they are on the website and can get used to the website structure more easily. </p>
                        <li><b>increased findability:</b> breadcrumbs give users another touchpoint to the content and help to catch the structure of the website</li>
                        <li><b>fewer clicks needed:</b> with breadcrumbs, website visitors can jump from one level of the hierarchy to any previous step with no effort and no need to take all the way back</li>
                        <li><b>effective use of screen space:</b>crafted well, breadcrumbs take a narrow horizontal line with plain-looking text elements that don’t need much space</li>
                        <li><b>no misinterpretation:</b> breadcrumbs are hardly ever misunderstood by users: the behavior pattern for them has solidified through years, and people rarely mistake this element for anything else</li>
                        <li><b>lower bounce rate:</b> breadcrumbs are a great support for first-time visitors or people that have no everyday experience of dealing with complex websites, so the more confident they feel, the slimmer is the chance of them bouncing the page.</li>
                    <p>As well as with internal website search, breadcrumbs are helpful in cases when the website has multiple pages and a complex hierarchy consisting of multiple layers. Breadcrumbs are common – and expected by users – in big e-commerce websites and platforms, media and news websites, blogs, and magazines covering a wide range of topics, etc. Yet, if that’s not your case and your website has a simple hierarchy, primary navigation will be enough to let the users effectively interact with it.</p>
                    
                    <img src="" alt="">

                <h2>Form</h2>
                    <p>Form is an interactive element that allows users to send information to the system or server. In a nutshell, it is a digital version of any real paper form we have to fill in to provide someone with the arranged information; however, digital forms can have more options and functionality to make this process even more smooth, clear, and user-friendly. As it is a traditional and well-recognized pattern of collecting the data, users deal with forms quite often in their digital lives, starting from the process of registration, adding personal or financial details, making payments, sending feedback, subscribing to a newsletter, etc.</p>
                    
                    <img src="" alt="">

                    <source src="" type="">

                <h2>Cards</h2>
                    <P>Cards, also called tiles, are layout elements that help arrange and visualize homogeneous data or content in a <a href="">scannable</a> and easy-to-use way. Cards are usually organized in a sort of grid, but each card looks like a separate piece in this system. Cards can combine different types of content about a particular item. For example, a product preview card on a catalog page can include an image, a title, basic functionality of adding it to a shopping cart or saving to the wishlist, etc.</P>
                    
                    <source src="" type="">

                    <img src="" alt="">

                    <img src="" alt="">

                <h2>Video</h2>
                    <p>Video is not a really basic part of a web page, but with the progress of web development solutions and technical abilities, we can find it more and more often on the website of different kinds these days. As mentioned in the article about <a href="">video content in UX design</a>, a catchy video crafted with an understanding of the target audience is a tool attracting customers’ attention as well as a well-checked method of informing them quickly and brightly. Video content activates several channels of perception – audio, visual, motion – simultaneously, and usually does that wrapped in telling a story. Such a combination of factors often makes a video presentation strong, emotional, and memorable.</p>
                    
                    <source src="" type="">

                <h2>Progress Indicator</h2>
                    <p>Progress indicator is a small but helpful element that helps the visitor to understand the current point in the general volume of information or set of actions. It is beneficial on the pages loaded with text content and supposing long scrolling, like long-read articles or guides, for example. Due to this indicator, users don’t get lost and can estimate the time needed for reading or browsing better.</p>
                    
                    <img src="" alt="">

                <h2>Favicon</h2>
                    <p>Favicon, also known as URL icon or bookmark icon, is a special type of symbol representing the product or brand in the URL-line of the browser and in the bookmark tab. It allows users to get a quick visual connection with it while they are browsing. This interface element proved itself effective for productive website promotion and good recognizability of its visual identity. Being super small, it makes a great contribution to web usability.</p>
                    
                    <img src="" alt="">

                <h2>Tags</h2>
                    <p>That’s another element of secondary navigation level, often found in blogs and websites with plenty of homogenous content. Tag is presented with a keyword or phrase that enables users to jump directly to the items marked up with it. Tags are actually pieces of metadata that provide quick access to specific content categories, so they support navigation with the additional way of content classification. Moreover, tags are often the elements that users create by themselves, so they become an alternative to the names of categories that are fixed by the website and can’t be changed by users.</p>
                    
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <img src="" alt="">

                    <p>The choice of the elements to add to a specific web page should be based on the harmonic combination of user goals and business goals behind it as well as it’s crucial to test the solutions and update them on the basis of the feedback from real interactions. Sure, this article was just an introduction to the anatomy of a web page, so keep up with new posts in Tubik Blog to dive into more details.</p>
